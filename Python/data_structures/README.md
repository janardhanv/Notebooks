# Notebook
This notebook serves as my public repository of various learning notes and exercises spanning Mathematics, programming, Houdini tools, and others. I make effort toward producing quality and accurate notes and, therefore, my content output may be slow. But contents here will be updated and added over time. 

### Data Structures
While data structures here are quite elementary and common, still they form a foundation in solving data problems pertaining to in storage and retrieval efficiencies. We begin with a very specialized data structures such as stack and queues, linked-list, and binary trees. From binary trees, we begin to generalize toward well-known m-ary tree and graphs. Having these back-bone and programming trainings, these will help us see problem-solution structures and consider their applications.

#### To-Do's
 1. Learn and implement Priority Queues using binary heaps.
 1. Maps (Dicts/Associate-Arrays) and Sets
 1. Common sort algorithms
 1. Basic graphs algorithms
