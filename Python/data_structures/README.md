# Notebook
This notebook serves as my public repository of various learning notes and exercises spanning Mathematics, programming, Houdini tools, and others. I make effort toward producing quality and accurate notes and, therefore, my content output may be slow. But contents here will be updated and added over time. 

### Data Structures
While data structures here are quite elementary and common, still they form a foundation in solving data problems pertaining to in storage and retrieval efficiencies. We begin with a very specialized data structures such as stack and queues, linked-list, and binary trees. From binary trees, we begin to generalize toward well-known m-ary tree and graphs. Having these back-bone and programming trainings, these will help us see problem-solution structures and consider their applications.

### Learning Outcome
 1. Stack and Queue and Deque: 
    * Understand an object-oriented design method called Abstract Base Class (ABC); how ABC can guarantee that such object will have certain method available in a larger software context; also useful as a "checklist" of what needs to be implemented in an Abstract Data Type (ADT).
    * Understand design and encapsulation differences between Stack, Queue, and Double-Ended Queue.
    * Possible applications of Queue could be to build and traverse level-order binary tree; using Deque to implement round-robin games and model ticket booth, etc.
 1. Linked-List
    * Understand differences between array and linked-list; pros and cons in terms of memory usage and random access time
    * Understand the differences between singly, circular, and doubly linked-list
    * Understand the challenges in terms of their implementations and ease of use.
 1. Binary Tree (special case of m-ary tree&mdash; which also special case of Graph)
    * Understand property of binary tree; how to build and traverse a tree
    * Possible applications may include: binary space partitioning, k-d tree, nearest-neighbor issue, heap and priority queue, etc.
 1. Priority Queue


### To-Do's
 1. Maps (Dicts/Associative-Arrays) and Sets
 1. Common sort algorithms
 1. Basic graphs algorithms
